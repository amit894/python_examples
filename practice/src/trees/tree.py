# Perfect Binary Tree : A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
# Balanced Binary Tree : A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. 
# Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible
